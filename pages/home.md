The **µOS++ IIIe** _(micro oh ɛs plus plus third edition)_ project is the third iteration of µOS++, a POSIX-like, portable, open source, royalty-free, multi-tasking real-time operating system intended for 32/64-bits embedded applications, written in C++. The project is hosted on GitHub as [micro-os-plus](https://github.com/micro-os-plus). It has a comprehensive [User's manual]({{ site.baseurl }}/user-manual/).

**CMSIS++** is a proposal for a future CMSIS, written in C++, and is the core component of **µOS++ IIIe**, defining the system APIs. These APIs are documented in the [CMSIS++ reference]({{ site.baseurl }}/reference/cmsis-plus/).

**POSIX++** is another point of view of the project; with most system APIs using the POSIX semantics, but being written in C++, the **µOS++ IIIe** APIs can also be seen as a C++ version of POSIX, thus the name **POSIX++**.

## Twofold identity

The **µOS++ IIIe** project can be considered from two points of view.

### The µOS++ packages

From a modular point of view, **µOS++ IIIe** is a **collection of packages** hosted on GitHub in two locations:

* the original code is grouped under the [µOS++ IIIe / CMSIS++](https://github.com/micro-os-plus) GitHub collection of projects
* projects based on third party code are grouped under the [xPacks](https://github.com/xpacks) collection.

### The µOS++ RTOS

From an embedded system point of view, **µOS++ IIIe** provides the **reference implementation** for the CMSIS++ **scheduler** and **portable synchronisation** objects (like mutex, semaphore, etc).
