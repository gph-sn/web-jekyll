Core classes
============

OSCPU
-----

The class [OSCPU]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSCPU) groups all CPU related calls and functionality. Here should be defined all CPU specifics, like

OSCPUImpl
---------

The [OSCPUImpl]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSCPUImpl) class is a portability helper for the **OSCPU** class.

Here are defined the non-portable methods, specific to each architecture or family.

OS
--

Without having any specific functionality, the [OS]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OS) class is a placeholder for all µOS++ related members and methods that did not find their way in other classes.

The non-portable methods are based on the **OSImpl** class, where the actual implementation is defined.

OSImpl
------

The [OSImpl]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSImpl) class is a portability helper for the **OS** class.

Here are defined the non-portable methods, specific to each architecture or family.

OSScheduler
-----------

The [OSScheduler]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSScheduler) class implements the main µOS++ functionality, i.e. the preemptive scheduler.

The non portable methods are based on the **OSSchedulerImpl** class, where the actual implementation is defined.

OSSchedulerImpl
---------------

The [OSSchedulerImpl]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSSchedulerImpl) class is a portability helper for the **OSScheduler** class.

Here are defined the non-portable methods, specific to each architecture or family.

OSTask
------

The [OSTask]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSTask) class is the parent class for all tasks running in the µOS++ environment.

OSTaskIdle
----------

The [OSTaskIdle]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSTaskIdle) class is the implementation of the µOS++ idle task, i.e. the lowest priority task that gets control when no other task is running.

It has several functionalities:

-   to make the processor enter the idle mode, waiting for the next interrupt
-   to execute a yield(), to guarantee that tasks that were waken by non-rescheduling interrupts are scheduled for execution

OSTimer
-------

The [OSTimer]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSTimer) class is the parent class of all system timer classes.

OSTimerTicks
------------

The [OSTimerTicks]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSTimerTicks) class implements the main timer functionality in µOS++.

As the name implies, all timing intervals of this timer are expressed in ticks, more precisely in scheduler ticks.

OSTimerSeconds
--------------

The [OSTimerSeconds]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSTimerSeconds) class implements the second system timer functionality, intended to measure longer intervals.

As the name implies, all timing intervals of this timer are expressed in seconds.

For systems equipped with a Real Time Clock, this timer runs completely independently, even when the device is in sleep or deep sleep mode.

For systems not equipped with a RTC, this time is derived from the existing **OSTimerTicks**.

Timer
-----

The [Timer]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_Timer) class is the parent class of all custom timer classes.

OSMutex
-------

The [OSMutex]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSMutex) class implements a mutual exclusion (mutex) inter-task synchronisation mechanism.

OSEventFlags
------------

The [OSEventFlags]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSEventFlags) class implements an inter-task synchronisation mechanism allowing a task to wait for multiple events, defined as separate flags in a structure.

Device classes
==============

OSDeviceDebug
-------------

The [OSDeviceDebug]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceDebug) class is the parent class of all debug classes used for displaying trace messages.

DeviceDebugI2C
--------------

The [DeviceDebugI2C]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_DeviceDebugI2C) class is the implementation of **OSDeviceDebug** where the output device is implemented as a master I2C using two generic IP pins via bit-banging.

The main advantage of such a mechanism is independence from processor speed and from specific hardware.

OSDeviceCharacter
-----------------

The [OSDeviceCharacter]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceCharacter) class is the parent class of all character devices in µOS++. A *character* device is defined as a device having the transfer unit as low as one ASCII character.

Example of such devices are USART, CDC USB.

OSDeviceCharacterBuffered
-------------------------

The [OSDeviceCharacterBuffered]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceCharacterBuffered) class is derived from OSDeviceCharacter and implements circular buffers for RX and TX.

DeviceCharacterBufferedBase
---------------------------

The [OSDeviceCharacterBufferedBase]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceCharacterBufferedBase) class is derived from OSDeviceCharacterBuffered and contain generic implementation for all USART's.

DeviceCharacterBufferedUsart0
-----------------------------

The [OSDeviceCharacterBufferedUsart0]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceCharacterBufferedUsart0) class is derived from OSDeviceCharacterBase and contain specific implementation for USART0.

DeviceCharacterBufferedUsart1
-----------------------------

The [OSDeviceCharacterBufferedUsart1]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSDeviceCharacterBufferedUsart1) class is derived from OSDeviceCharacterBase and contain specific implementation for USART1.

Type definitions
================

OSTimerStruct_t
----------------

The [OSTimerStruct_t]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Typedef_OSTimerStruct_t) type definition is used in OSTimer for storing the timeout set for a certain task.

OSTimerTicks_t
---------------

The [OSTimerTicks_t]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Typedef_OSTimerTicks_t) type definition is used in ... (TBD)

OSEventWaitReturn_t
--------------------

-------------------

The [OSEventFlagsBits_t]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Typedef_OSEventFlagsBits_t) type definition is used in [OSEventFlags]({{ site.baseurl }}/micro-os-plus/i/Class_OSEventFlags) inter-task synchronization.
